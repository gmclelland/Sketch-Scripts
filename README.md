Sketch-Scripts
==============

Collection of scripts I wrote for the Sketch App by [Bohemian code](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch).

## Split into grid

Since I started using Sketch, I missed this feature from Illustrator. While "Make grid" can be used, it is (IMO) not usable o reven the case I want when doing wireframes. Make a grid creates a grid using the selection as starting point.

This script uses a selection as the area that will hold the grid.

How to use: Simply select an rectangle you want to split into the grid and enter the values for Columns, Rows and Gutter.
