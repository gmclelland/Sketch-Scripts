## Split into grid

Since I started using Sketch, I missed this feature from Illustrator. While "Make grid" can be used, it is (IMO) not usable or 
even the case I want when doing wireframes.

How to use: Simply select an rectangle you want to split into the grid and enter the values for Columns, Rows and Gutter.
